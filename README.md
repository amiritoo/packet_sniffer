**What is packet sniffing?**

Packet sniffing is the practice of gathering, collecting, and logging some or all packets that pass through a computer network, regardless of how the packet is addressed. In this way, every packet, or a defined subset of packets, may be gathered for further analysis. You as a network administrators can use the collected data for a wide variety of purposes like monitoring bandwidth and traffic.

A packet sniffer, sometimes called a packet analyzer, is composed of two main parts. First, a network adapter that connects the sniffer to the existing network. Second, software that provides a way to log, see, or analyze the data collected by the device.



**What kind of information does packet sniffing gather?**

Packet sniffing collects the entire packet of each network transmission. Packets that are not encrypted can be reassembled and read in their entirety. For example, intercepted packets from a user accessing a website would include the HTML and CSS of the web pages. Most notoriously, users logging in to network resources across unencrypted transmissions expose their username and password as plain text that can be seen in captured packets.
